            <p>Hello!  My name is Jeremiah Astin.  I am currently an applied technologies student at Brigham Young University Idaho Online.  I have always been interested in computers and the internet and I have really enjoyed learning how to design and develop websites.</p>
            <p>I was born in Anchorage, Alaska, but my father was in the AirForce so we moved all around the country.  I currently reside in Dayton, Ohio where I have lived for the last 15 years.  I am married to my lovely wife Ashley and we have a baby girl named Karleigh and pit bull named Emma.  In 2010 I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Marketing from Wright State University.  I currently work as the Director of Ticketing <a href="https://www.daytonlive.org/" target="new">Dayton Live</a>, a local performing arts organization.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, watching movies, and spending time with my family.  I also enjoy traveling and visiting amusement parks.</p>
